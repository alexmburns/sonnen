notifcations.py

Pop in the relevant API details & the script will:
Notify you when your battery goes above 80 or below 20%.
Turn on a light when your battery goes above 80 or below 20% (if you have Google Home you can then use this to say, when X light turns on notifying me that my battery is high/low)
Provide a log of battery % and other useful information (max 100 entries).

notify-once.py

Does all of the above, but it terminates once it has triggered.
